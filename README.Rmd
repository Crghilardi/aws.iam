# AWS IAM Client Package #

**aws.iam** is a simple client package for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) API, which can be used to manage access credentials for AWS services.

## Installation ##

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/aws.iam)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=aws.iam)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudyr/aws.iam.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudyr/aws.iam) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/cloudyr/aws.iam/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/cloudyr/aws.iam?branch=master)

To install the latest development version from GitHub, run the following:

```R
if(!require("devtools")){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
}
install_github("cloudyr/aws.iam")
```

To install the latest version from CRAN, simply use `install.packages("aws.iam")`.

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. 

By default, all **cloudyr** packages look for the access key ID and secret access key in environment variables. You can also use this to specify a default region. For example:

```R
Sys.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1")
```

These can alternatively be set on the command line or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file ([see here for instructions](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)).
